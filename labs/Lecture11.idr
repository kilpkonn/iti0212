-- We can think of a term of a type as a proof of a proposition,
-- and we can manipulate these proofs in our programs
-- just like any other expressions.




{-  Proving Properties by Constructing Terms  -}


{-  On dependent pattern matching:

 * A *term* of type Even n acts as
   a *proof* that n is even.

 * A *context variable* of type Even n acts as
   an *assumption* that n is even.

 * We can use pattern matching to examine the possible
   constructor forms that such an assumption can have.

 * Because the type Even n is indexed by the type Nat,
   case analyzing an assumption of type Even n
   gives us information about the indexing Nat n as well.
 -}


-- The constructor SS_even says that the double-successor
-- of an even number is even.
-- We can prove the converse as well:
pp_even  :  Even (S (S n)) -> Even n
pp_even (SS_even n_even)  =  n_even




{-  Proof Validity and Totality  -}

-- Only a total term of a type corresponds to
-- a valid proof of the respective proposition:
partial
everything_even  :  (n : Nat) -> Even n
everything_even n  =  everything_even n





-- The sum of two even numbers is even

{- On proof strategy:

 * Addition is defined by recursion on its first argument
   so we try doing induction on the assumption
   corresponding to the first summand.

 * The assumption Even m is indexed by the the Nat m
   and we can bring it into scope to give ourselves
   control over its name.

		IH  =  even_plus_even m_even n_even
	in
		SS_even IH

--   Even $ S (S m) + n
-->  Even $ S (S m + n)
-->  Even $ S (S (m + n))



{-  On proof engineering:

 * For a variety of reasons, Idris may not show you all of
   the information you want about intermediate proof states.

 * We will learn about several strategies to deal with this.
   Today we focus on two.

-- Once we have found a proof, we may choose to
-- inline the local definitions
-- or remove the explicated implicit arguments
