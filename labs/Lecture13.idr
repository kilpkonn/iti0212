{-  Falsity  -}

-- In the propositions-as-booleans interpretation
-- we can assert not only that something is true,
-- but also that it is false:

two_is_three  :  Bool
two_is_three  =  2 == 3


-- How can we assert that something is false
-- in the propositions-as-types interpretation?

Two_Is_Three  :  Type
Two_Is_Three  =  2 = 3


{-
 * Recall that we represent a proposition by a type and 
   a proof of a proposition by an element of that type.

 * One way to assert that a proposition is false
   is to claim that there can be no proofs of it.

 * A proposition with no proofs corresponds to
   a type with no elements; i.e. an empty type.
 -}


-- Recall the empty type  Void  from lecture 2:
data  Void' : Type  where
	--  no constructors!


-- Writing a function from the  Void  type to another type
-- is trivial because there are no cases to consider.

-- (this is in the standard library as  void)
trivial  :  Void -> a
trivial x  impossible


-- But writing functions to the  Void  type  from another type
-- is possible only if:


-- (1) the function is not total:
partial
hopeless  :  Nat -> Void   --  this function has the right type,
hopeless n  =  hopeless n  --  but it will never return a value


-- (2) the other type is also empty:

pointless  :  Fin 0 -> Void
pointless i  impossible




{-  Negation as Refutation  -}

-- We can use a total function to the  Void  type to express
-- the negation of a proposition interpreted as a type.
-- (this is in the Prelude as  Not)
Not'  :  Type -> Type
Not' a  =  a -> Void

{-
 * An element of type  Not a  is a function sending
   elements of type  a  to elements of type  Void.

 * But there are no elements of type  Void.

 * So if this function is total then there can be
   no elements of type  a  either.

 * Thus  a  must be an empty type.

 * If we interpret the type  a  as a proposition,
   this means that it can have no proofs.

 * Which is what it means to assert that it is false.

-- In the propsitions-as-booleans interpretation
-- we can use the boolean negation function to define
-- the predicate of a number bing odd:
public export
is_odd  :  Nat -> Bool
is_odd  =  not . is_even


-- In the propsitions-as-types interpretation
-- we can do the same thing using type-level negation:
public export
Odd  :  Nat -> Type
Odd  =  Not . Even


-- Of course, one is odd:
public export
one_odd  :  Odd 1
one_odd Z_even  impossible
one_odd (SS_even n)  impossible


-- We can show that the successor of an even number is odd
-- by induction on the assumption  Even n:

		IH = succ_even_odd n_even
	in
		IH . pp_even



-- We can show that the successor of an odd number is even,
-- but we can't pattern match on the assumption  Odd n
-- because  Odd  is not an inductively defined type.
-- However, we can pattern match on its  Nat  index  n:

-- The sandard library includes implementations of  Uninhabited
-- for many types corresponding to false propositions,
-- including  Z = S n  and  S n = Z.
-- We can extend this to any differing Nats:
public export
implementation  Uninhabited (m = n) => Uninhabited (S m = S n)  where
	uninhabited  =  uninhabited . pred_equal


-- The Uninhabited interface provides a method,
-- absurd : Uninhabited a => a -> b.
-- This is like the function  void  for the type  Void,
-- but for arbitrary empty types.
